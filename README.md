# scratch2svg

A buggy tool for generating .svg thumbnails from Scratch projects. Work in progress!!!

## Why?

If you want to take a screenshot of a Scratch project that:

- Is **super high resolution**
- Barely uses your storage
- **Looks good at any size**

Then this is the tool for you!

## Roadmap

Some of these things are probably unnecessary and might not even happen if I find something better to do with my life, but I guess it's good to stay committed. :|

  - [ ] Fix positioning bug ([#1](https://github.com/OceanIsEndless/scratch2svg/issues/1))

The conversion code uses [UZIP](https://github.com/photopea/UZIP.js) to unzip any zipped project files passed as input.

The [Scratch Wiki](https://scratch-wiki.info) was used as reference for some stuff. (E.g. how to read the [Scratch File Format](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_File_Format). <small>I know, I know. Shame on me for not writing the [Scratch spec](https://oceanisendless.github.io/scratch-spec/) already. It's coming soon though! Don't you worry... yet.)
